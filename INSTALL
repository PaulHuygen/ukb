You need the following Boost libraries to compile ukb:

      * boost graph library
      * boost program options 
      * boost filesystem
      * boost tokenizer
      * boost lexical cast

Then, just run by the standard compilation procedure:

# Check dependencies and generate Makefile

% ./configure 

# the ./configure script has some options (./configure --help to see them
# all). The important options are:
#
#  --prefix
#             path were the executables will be installed (after 'make
#             install')
#
#  --with-boost-include
#            path were the Boost include files reside (default is
#            /usr/include/boost)
#
#  --with-boost-lib
#            path were the Boost library files reside (default is /usr/lib)

# Compile 

% make

# The executables are now in the current directory. Now, if you want to
# install them on a different location, just 'cp' them, or execute

% make install
